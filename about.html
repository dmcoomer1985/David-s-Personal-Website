        <h2>--When I am not working with software developmnent, while maintaining a healthy-work-life balance,
            I'm doing the following things.
        </h2>

            <h2>Traveling</h2>
            <img src="https://a.travel-assets.com/findyours-php/viewfinder/images/res60/471000/471847-Bourbon-Street.jpg" alt="New Orleans" width="300" height="200">
            <p>One of my favorite things to do when I am not working or producing code is traveling. Some of the places that I have visited consist of New Orleans, Louisiana, Las Vegas, Nevada, Florida,
            and many others.</p>
            <p>When I travel I like to learn about the culture, food, and history of the place I'm traveling to such as in New Orleans. When I travel to Florida it is all about theme parks and the beach! Finally Las Vegas, it is all about the expierence!</p>
            <p>One of my expierences in New Orleans was with the famous Ghost tours where you get on a bus and travel to supposedly haunted locations. 
            It is filled with history and I got to see the house from American Horror Story Covenant!</p>

            <h2>Gaming</h2>

            <p>What software developer doesn't like to play games? I know this one does! Being in the technology field I have always had a love at heart for gaming.</p>
            <p>One of my favorite gaming platforms to game off of is the PlayStation 5. I enjoy playing open world games such as Assassin's Creed Valhalla, and Red Dead Redemption 2.</p>
            <p>I think what attracts me to the PlayStation is the rich gaming using a simple controller but integrated with Speakers and vibration. The graphics almost measure up to what some computers are running.</p>
            <p>I am not a big fan with computer gaming so I will stick to my PlayStation and it's rich environment.</p>

            <h2>Movies and Autographs</h2>
            <img src="award-2969422_640.jpg" alt="The Movies" 
                width:="200"
                 height:="200">
            <p>When I am not gaming and traveling you can find me watching movies and collecting Autographs from movie stars.</p>
            <p>I collect movies, and have currently over 200 movies in my collection. Within the last couple of years I started upgrading my technology to 4K.</p>
            <p>Since the pandemic I have tried to recreate the theatre expierence in my own home by adding a Sonos soundbar and subwoofer as well as  4K Tv's and player.</p>
            <p>I am also in love with how the technology works in the cloud where you can buy movies and then add them using digital codes and have them in a collection to stream which makes it more convinent then disc. I use Vudu or Movies Anywhere so check them out!</p>
            <p>I am also proud to say that I collect celebrity autographs and have a few I am particularly proud of. Some of those are John Carpenter, George Lazenby who plays James Bond, and several other Characters from James Bond movies to name a few.</p>
