        <h2>Movie Guide</h2>
        <img src="1154.jpg" alt="Movie Guide"
             width="300"
             heigh="300"/>
        <div>
            <p>For my first project I created a movie guide that displayed posters,  and had trailers that would play for each poster. It even had a review section 
               and a search bar where you could search for different movies.</p>
            <p>This was created using an API, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS and of course countless hours of hard work.</p>
            <p>Another feature that the movie guide had was the ability to search for local listings for movies in an individuals area.</p>
            <p>This app would be good for someone who wanted more information about a particular movie they were interested in seeing. I felt like this was the perfect app to Building
               since I have a passion for collecting movies.</p>

       <h2>Building an About Me Website</h2>
       <img src="5116403.jpg" alt="About Me"
            width="300"
            height="300"/>
       <p>The second thing I built was an about me website. This was a very basic website that I built. It would feature HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files.</p>
       <p>To show my skills some of the things it features are vibrant backgrounds, pictures, and links to all the pages. Other things are my knowledge of places I have traveled,and
        things I like to do like watching movies and gaming.</p>
       <p>When I build websites I really enjoy creating code and then decorating with CSS. It surprises and amazes me all the things I can do with a touch of a button.</p>

        <h2>Building a Travel App</h2>
        <img src="full-shot-travel-concept-with-landmarks.jpg" alt="Traveling the Globe"
             width="300"
             height="300" />
        <p>The last project that I built was a travel app. It would run on a computer website and was extremely simple.
        It incorporated a travel planner to help you plan your travels by creating a list for things you need to pack to take with you.</p>
        <p>Another feature is it had a search function that allowed users to find hotels, flights, and other travel deals in their desired location. </p>
        <p>I got the idea to build a travel app from my love of traveling to different places in the past few years. I realized that there was not alot of websites or applications
        that had a packing list and a search engine built into it, to help the individual find the best deals.</p>
        <p>When I say the best deals we are looking at deals from rental vehicles, flights, hotel air bnb and more.</p>
